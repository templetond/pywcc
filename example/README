Bradys Hot Springs Test
=======================

PyWCC can be tested on the included Bradys Hot Springs geothermal field test 
dataset. This data is a subset of the data available from the Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory Induced Seismicity Data Website. 30 days of continuous data is 
included in the example/ContinuousData directory, sorted by days. Template event 
waveform data is included in the example/TemplateData directory, sorted by event. 
Template events were identified from the original catalog event and only include 
those with good signal-to-noise ratio in the frequency band of interest. A catalog 
of the template events is included in file example/TemplateCatalog. An example input
file is included in the file example/InputFile.


Bradys Usage
=============

Once dependencies are installed and PyWCC is downloaded, the PyWCC Bradys test case 
example can also be run from the command line within the example directory: 

>> /anaconda/bin/python ../PyWCC/WaveformCC.py ./InputFile

or from a Matlab prompt within the example directory:

>> [status,out] = system(‘/anaconda/bin/python ../PyWCC/WaveformCC.py ./InputFile’)

where a status of zero indicates that the command has completed successfully and
the out variable contains any status messages printed to screen.


Bradys Output
=============

Using the input parameters in the included InputFile, output detection files
for days 07 April 2014 to 09 April 2014 are included in the OutputFiles
directory. No other detections were identified outside of this swarm using the
InputFile parameters on the remaining days in the example/ContinuousData data.
Events in the output files include self-identification of the template events,
template events identifying non-template original catalog events, and templates
identifying new events that were excluded/missed from the original catalog. Waveforms 
and spectrograms of all detections (plotted using an external program) are included
in the Misc directory for user verification and convenience.
